### 1. Standard Markdown Essentials (Included in GFM)

These are the core CommonMark features that GFM fully supports and builds upon.

**Headings:**

```markdown
# H1 (Title)
## H2
### H3
```

**Paragraphs:**

```markdown
This is one paragraph.

This is a second paragraph.
```

**Emphasis:**

```markdown
*Italic* or _Italic_
**Bold** or __Bold__
***Bold and Italic***
```

**Lists:**

```markdown
* Unordered item 1
* Unordered item 2
  * Nested item (indent with 2 spaces)

1. Ordered item 1
2. Ordered item 2
```

**Links and Images:**

```markdown
[Link Text](https://example.com)
![Image Alt Text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```

**Blockquotes:**

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
> It can span multiple lines.
```

**Inline Code:**

```markdown
Use single backticks for `inline code` or commands.
```

**Fenced Code Blocks:**

````markdown
```javascript
function helloWorld() {
    console.log("Hello!");
}
```
````

**Reference-Style Links and Images:**

```markdown
Here is a [link to Google][google-ref] and another to [GitHub][github-ref].

[google-ref]: https://google.com "Google Search"
[github-ref]: https://github.com
```

**Hard Line Breaks:**

```markdown
This is line one.\
This is line two directly below it.
```

**Thematic Breaks (Horizontal Rules):**

```markdown
---
***
___
```

**Setext Headings:**

```markdown
Heading Level 1
===============

Heading Level 2
---------------
```

**Escaping Characters:**

```markdown
I literally want to type \*these asterisks\* without making the text italic.
```

### 2. Standard GFM Extensions

These are the formal extensions that distinguish GFM from plain CommonMark.

* **Task Lists:** Create interactive checkboxes.

```markdown
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Incomplete task
```

* **Tables:** Organize data with columns and rows. Use colons to align text.

```markdown
| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| Row 1        | Data           | $100          |
| Row 2        | Data           | $200          |
```

* **Strikethrough:** Cross out text using double tildes.

```markdown
~~This text is crossed out~~
```

* **Autolinks:** Bare URLs and email addresses automatically turn into clickable links without needing angle brackets `< >` or standard link syntax.

```markdown
Visit https://github.com
Contact support@example.com
```

* **Disallowed Raw HTML:** Some raw HTML tags are treated as literal text rather than HTML. This is a specific GFM extension and is separate from GitHub's broader HTML sanitization rules.

### 3. GitHub.com Markdown Features

These are commonly supported on GitHub, but they are platform features rather than part of the official GFM specification.

* **Alerts (Admonitions):** Add distinctive styling to blockquotes to emphasize critical information. There are five supported types.

```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.

> [!TIP]
> Optional information to help a user be more successful.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.

> [!WARNING]
> Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.

> [!CAUTION]
> Negative potential consequences of an action.
```

* **Mathematical Expressions:** GitHub supports LaTeX-style math in some Markdown contexts.

```markdown
Inline math uses a single dollar sign:
$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$

Block math uses double dollar signs:
$$
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$
```

* **Footnotes:** GitHub supports clickable, numbered references at the bottom of a document.

```markdown
Here is a sentence that needs a citation[^1].

[^1]: This is the referenced footnote at the bottom of the page.
```

* **GitHub-Specific Autolinks:** GitHub automatically parses and links platform-specific references without extra markdown syntax.

```markdown
Mention a user or team: @username or @org/team
Reference an issue or Pull Request: #123
Reference a specific commit: a1b2c3d4e5f6 (typing the SHA automatically links it)
```

* **Collapsible Sections (HTML):** While technically HTML, this is commonly used on GitHub to keep long issue descriptions or PRs tidy. *(Note: You must leave a blank line after the `<summary>` tag for the nested Markdown to render correctly.)*

```html
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

  This content is hidden by default. Standard **Markdown** works here!
</details>
```

* **Emoji Shortcodes:** GitHub parses standard emoji shortcodes wrapped in colons.

```markdown
I am feeling :smile: and :tada: today!
```

* **Relative Links:** Standard Markdown link destinations can already be relative, but GitHub resolves them naturally within a repository's file structure.

```markdown
[Read the Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
[View the logo](../assets/logo.png)
```

* **Syntax Highlighting Aliases:** While you mentioned Fenced Code Blocks, it's worth noting that GFM relies on Linguist for syntax highlighting, which means it accepts hundreds of language identifiers and aliases.

```text
(e.g., using `js` or `javascript`, `py` or `python`, `sh` or `bash`)
```
